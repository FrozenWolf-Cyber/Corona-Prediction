# Corona-Prediction
Solving time series problem with neural network.

Dataset is collected from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/kernels?sortBy=hotness&group=everyone&pageSize=20&datasetId=494724

We are using a neural netowrk to predict the total number of death , recovered patients , number of confirmed cases.
We are also analysing the data and visualizing it in different ways to get a better overview about the problem.
